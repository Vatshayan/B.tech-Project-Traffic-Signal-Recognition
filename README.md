# Traffic-Signal-Recognition

In this project, the knowledge and Idea about deep neural networks and convolution neuronal networks in special was applied to a real-world problem by using the deep learning Framework Keras with TensorFlow as backend. A convolutional neural network was built and then trained to classify german traffic signs. For that purpose, a dataset with over 50000 images was used. Afterwards, the model is tested with different traffic signs images from the web, to see how it performs in the real world.


This Can be your B.tech Project. {Project Guide and Mentor will happily accept this project}

Data Discription :

The size of training set is 34799 images
The size of the validation set is 4410 images, that are 12.67% of the training set size
The size of test set is 12630 images
The shape of a traffic sign image is 32 x 32 x 3
The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

It's fully Python programming Project.
